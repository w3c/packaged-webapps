    <section id='abstract'>
      This specification defines a media feature to match the different visual presentation modes that
      can be applied to web applications and thereby apply different styling based on these
    different modes using <cite>CSS Media Queries</cite> [[!MEDIAQ]]. </section>

    <section id='sotd'></section>

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <a title='Web application'>Web applications</a>, be they widgets or in-browser, can on most platforms
        be run in multiple visual modes. At times they may occupy the entire screen, at others they may be 
        minimized to a specific docking area; at times they may have chrome that matches the operating 
        system's style while at others they may be providing their own controls in order to provide for 
        a more <a>immersive</a> experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user is generally in control of at least several aspects of these modalities, and it is
        therefore important for authors to be able to react to these in order to provide different
        styling to their applications. In order to achieve this, this specification defines a
        <a>media feature</a> that allows different CSS style rules to be applied depending on whether
        a given media query [[!MEDIAQ]] matches.
      </p>
      <section class='informative'>
        <h2>Design Goals and Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          The design goals and requirements for this specification are documented in the 
        <cite>Requirements for Standardizing Widgets</cite> [[WIDGETS-REQS]]. </p>
        <p>
          This document addresses one requirement from 
          "<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-widgets-reqs-20090430/#user-experience'>User Experience</a>":
        </p>

          <li><a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-widgets-reqs-20090430/#display-modes'>Display Modes</a></li>
        </ol>
      </section>
</section>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product:
        <dfn id="product-ua" title='user agent'>user agents</dfn> that implement the <a>view modes</a> that it contains.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security considerations</h2>
      <p>
        An application could be designed to trick users into performing actions they do not wish to or to capture
        data that they did not intend to provide. Examples of situations in which the user could be tricked
        include, but are not limited to:
      </p>
     	<ul>
     	  <li>
     	    applications that the user cannot see (full-screen invisible widgets or tiny web pages) that can be used
     	    to run services without the user noticing or to intercept the user's interactions with other
     	    applications (such as a PIN-code entry) by layering themselves on top of them;
     	  </li>
     	  <li>
     	    applications that have no chrome and that could therefore masquerade as some other existing objects on 
     	    the screen (for example a lock and key logo indicating that a site a trustworthy).
     	  </li>
     	</ul>
     	<p>
     	  Implementers are encouraged to take these issues into consideration and to provide limitations to what
     	  a <a>Web application</a> may do in order to ensure that the user is exposed to minimal risk.

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>View mode</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The <a>view mode</a> is the manner in which a <a>Web application</a> is presented to a user that corresponds to
          the metaphors and functionalities in use on a given platform. This specification defines a number
          of view modes that a <a>user agent</a> is expected to match to comparable platform-specific
          situations.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Chrome</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The <a>chrome</a> comprises the visible parts of the <a>user agent</a> that do not depend on the 
          content (e.g. window decorations, tool bars, title bars, menus).
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Immersive</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A user interface is said to be immersive when its controls and components are created to match the
          specific style of the application instead of using the chrome and widgets of the platform.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Media feature</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The term <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1">media feature</a> is defined in 
          [[!MEDIAQ]].
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Screen area</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The area of the screen that is generally available for applications, excluding parts that the system
          generally keeps to itself (e.g. a bar at the top for menus, time, or context, or at the bottom with
          a list of running applications).
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Web application</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A Web application is an application built and shipped using Web technology that may be running
          inside of a browser, as a <a>widget</a>, or in another type of container designed for this
          purpose.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Widgets</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The term <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/#widget">widget</a> is defined in [[WIDGETS]].
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>Viewport</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The term <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a> is defined in [[CSS21]].

      <h2>The <code>'view-mode'</code> media feature</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn>view-mode</dfn> media feature describes the mode in which the <a>Web application</a> is being shown as a running
        application on the platform.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Value:</dt>
        <dd>
          <a>windowed</a> | <a>floating</a> | <a>fullscreen</a> | <a>maximized</a> | <a>minimized</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Applies to:</dt>
        <dd>

        <dt>Accepts min/max prefixes:</dt>
        <dd>
          No

      </dl>
      <p id="ta-vmmf">
        A <a class="product-ua" href="#product-ua">user agent</a> SHOULD make a best-effort attempt at matching the great variety of platform conventions
        in which it may be running a <a>Web application</a> to the list of view modes defined in this specification so that the
        <a>view-mode</a> media feature may describe common situations in a manner that is useful to authors.
        Each <a>view mode</a> is defined to be exclusive of the others.
      </p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>View modes</h2>
        <p>
          The <a>view-mode</a> media feature accepts the following enumerated values:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>windowed</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Describes a <a>Web application</a> running in a windowed manner, which is to say with <a>chrome</a> and 
            without occupying the entire <a>screen area</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>floating</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Describes a <a>Web application</a> providing a more <a>immersive</a> interface, running in a windowed manner but
            without <a>chrome</a>, and with the viewport's initial background being transparent such that other system items
            (other applications, the display's background...) can be seen through parts of the viewport that are not being 
            painted to.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>fullscreen</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Describes a <a>Web application</a> that is occupying the entirety of the display, including the parts normally
            excluded from the <a>screen area</a> (e.g. a fullscreen video) and without any <a>chrome</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>maximized</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Describes a <a>Web application</a> that is occupying the entirety of the <a>screen area</a> but with <a>chrome</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>minimized</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Describes a <a>Web application</a> docked or otherwise minimized, but with a dynamic graphical representation 
            being available nevertheless (i.e. the application isn't entirely hidden, or maybe its icon is still shown
            and it has control over what it contains). This may correspond for instance to a thumbnail of the 
            application's content being shown.
